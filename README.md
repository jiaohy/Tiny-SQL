# Tiny-SQL
Designed and implemented a SQL interpreter which can accept valid Tiny-SQL grammar and output the results of execution.
The interpreter included a user interface, a Parser which converted Tiny-SQL query into a parser tree, a logical query plan generator which could optimize the selection operations and a physical query plan generator which optimized the join operations.
